# Awful Tower

## About

This project started off as a game, with a level editor as part of the game.
I realized that there is no way I would have enough time to build the game, but
the level editor was coming along nicely. I decided to just scrap the
game for the time being and release an awesome level editor.

My goal is to create a lightweight map editor, that allows multiple people to
collaborate on maps at the **same time**.
